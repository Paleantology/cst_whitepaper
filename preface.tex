\chapter{Preface}

This compilation of mostly independent exercises is our substitute for a complete manual of \RevBayes.
The first three chapters cover the basic ideas, installation requirements and commands for running \RevBayes.
The following chapters target specific parts of a phylogenetic analysis.
Each chapter represents a 1.5 to 3 hour workshop session and is detailed enough to study independently at home.
We have grouped the exercises together by topics into parts.
We hope that you find the information provided helpful and welcome any feedback, criticism and suggestions.
