Dear Director Markie,

We are writing to ask you to consider our manuscript, ``The Why, When, and How of Computing in Biology Classrooms" for publication. 
Myself, Rachel Schwartz, Jamie Oaks, Catherine Newman and Sarah Flanagan have written this literature review to introduce biologists to technologies and teaching practices for teaching computation to biology students.
The aim of our article is to empower instructors to support student learning through effective classroom technology and pedagogy.

We are submitting this article to F1000 for several reasons.
The primary goal of our article is to help any biologist who wants to teach computation.
This goal would benefit from F1000's cross-disciplinary readership.
% The authors of this article come from several fields of evolutionary biology, including:
% genomics, systematics, biogeography, paleobiology.
Because this article is for educators, and has a special focus on diversity and inclusion, it is important that educators can access and read it for free.
F1000 is a leader in open access publishing, and we believe providing this article for free to be key to its message.

We have no conflicts to disclose. 
This is an original article not under consideration at any other journal.
We offer the following reviewer suggestions: Jessica Hamrick (jessica.b.hamrick@gmail.com), a core member of the Jupyter Notebook education team, Christina Koch (ckoch5@wisc.edu), an RStudio-certified computational educator, and Melissa Wilson (mwilsons@asu.edu), who has been an author on several publications in this area. 


Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
