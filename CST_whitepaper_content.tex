\section{Introduction}\label{sect:Introduction}

We have so many choices about how to teach a computation class! 
What's a girl to do?

\begin{itemize}
\item Biology departments are increasingly offering computational course work. This can come in a variety of forms from data science type work, to biostatistics, to big data work with genomic data.  
\item Educators have an array of choices in front of us. What language will we use? How will students interact with the materials? 
\item Every choice comes with costs and benefits. Our goal here is to explain some popular course service technologies, how they work and when they are the best choice for you
\item We will be explaining this with a special eye towards serving diverse sets of learners, both in terms of their motivations, and in terms of their life experiences.
\end{itemize}
